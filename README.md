Cybersecurity takes an important place in this more and more connected world. From big companies to personal computer, each download from the internet is a threat. To protect computers from unwanted malwares, some of the method used is having a database of known malware so whenever a file is downloaded, the hash of the malware is compared and can be effectively quarantined if known. But, to work, the malware must be known. But cybercriminals are creating more and more sophisticated malwares that are undetected. The goal of this work is to utilize Deep Learning(DL) to detect and classify malwares. It can enable the safe detection of newly created malware. The mathematical model will link the malware x and find it’s corresponding malware family y : f∶x ⟶y . To train our model, we will be using Malimg dataset. This dataset consist of malware images corresponding to 25 families. To obtain images of malware, we must convert it to 8 bit vector and to grayscale which will correspond to an image. The algorithm will consist of two parts, the Deep Learning algorithm using Convolutional Layers that will detect patterns in a given image, and the classification algorithm Support Vector Machine(SVC). Our model has an accuracy of 90%.!

In this repository, you will find a .ipynb that contains the code of our work, from the deep learning algorithm to the SVM machine learning algorithm. The code is entirely free to be re-used anywhere to continue the work.
You will also find a .pdf that contains explanation about the code.

# From Malware Binary to Image : Detecting malware using their image and Artificial Intelligence

Cybersecurity takes an important place in this more and more connected world. From big companies to personal computer, each download from the internet is a threat. To protect computers from unwanted malwares, some of the method used is having a database of known malware so whenever a file is downloaded, the hash of the malware is compared and can be effectively quarantined if known. But, to work, the malware must be known. But cybercriminals are creating more and more sophisticated malwares that are undetected. The goal of this work is to utilize Deep Learning(DL) to detect and classify malwares. It can enable the safe detection of newly created malware. The mathematical model will link the malware x and find it’s corresponding malware family y : f∶x ⟶y . To train our model, we will be using Malimg dataset. This dataset consist of malware images corresponding to 25 families. To obtain images of malware, we must convert it to 8 bit vector and to grayscale which will correspond to an image. The algorithm will consist of two parts, the Deep Learning algorithm using Convolutional Layers that will detect patterns in a given image, and the classification algorithm Support Vector Machine(SVC). Our model has an accuracy of 90%.!


# __Introduction of our work__

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, combating the proliferation of malware remains a pressing challenge. Traditional methods relying on signature-based detection struggle to keep pace with the exponential growth of new malware variants, leading to undetected threats lurking within systems. Addressing this gap requires innovative approaches that transcend the limitations of conventional detection mechanisms.

This work delves into a paradigm shift in malware analysis and classification, presenting a novel methodology to characterize and combat malware threats. Departing from the traditional reliance on binary signatures or the complexities of static and dynamic code analysis, this research introduces an unconventional approach. By harnessing the transformative power of deep learning (DL) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques, we aim to revolutionize malware detection and classification.

The focal point of this study revolves around visualizing malware binaries as images, leveraging the inherent similarities in their structural patterns. By representing malware executables as binary strings, reshaping them into matrices, and subsequently viewing them as images, we uncover striking visual correlations among malware belonging to the same family. This observation underscores the prevalence of code reuse in generating new malware variants and forms the foundation of our innovative classification methodology.

Utilizing the Malimg dataset, comprising visualized representations of malware binaries, we employ DL-SVM models trained on this data. This amalgamation of DL techniques with the discriminative power of SVM classification not only enables the identification of known malware but also exhibits a remarkable capacity to detect and classify newly-released and previously unseen threats. This adaptability arises from the models' ability to generalize from data, offering a robust defense mechanism against evolving and emerging malware.

Throughout this exploration, we unravel the intricacies of our approach, detailing the process of visualizing malware binaries as images, training DL-SVM models, and assessing their performance in automatically classifying malware families. Furthermore, we critically examine the limitations of this methodology and conclude with insights into the implications and future potential of this intelligent anti-malware system.
